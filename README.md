HTML/CSS/JS:

https://rpswpy.000webhostapp.com/
- Rock Paper Scissors with easy+hard difficulty. I also have one with Python as a server and ability to play other people, but I couldn't find a free web hosting site that supports Python.

https://sortthecourt.000webhostapp.com/
- A project I made for the UI course. The task was to create a mail sorting game with distractions. I went one step further.

I've also used WordPress to create a website called CuteMollis for a swedish client, but the site is no longer available.

Java:

https://github.com/Vazalemma/PR2_Projects
- A project that started out of personal interest, but I transitioned it into the 'practice final thesis' in university.
- There's an online flash game named Platform Racing 2. Using various bits of knowledge, I managed to program access to various functions that were inaccessible to common users.
- I created a bot that answers to private messages, I created a level transfering method between accounts, I managed to transform images into block data and create a level from it.
- But most importantly, I downloaded the game's whole level and user database to cheat at a monthly reoccurring event where you have to find a rare artifact hidden in a random level.
- The level would reveal in a "[level_name] by [user_name]" format (e.g. JumpMan by Player1) and letters would reveal one by one (e.g. __m_M____y_____e__).

https://github.com/Vazalemma/BitCoinDemo
- A crypto bitcoin-inspired project I created in university. Includes various layers of security, blockchains, hashes, etc. It's been a while so I forgot some details, but it might be interesting.

DataBases:

https://github.com/Vazalemma/PSQL_Examples
- I've used MySQLi and PostgreSQL in university, but since the Dijkstra servers TTÃœ hosted are now down, there's no good way to showcase them, so I've included it this way instead.
- I've also used Enterprise Architect and MS Access for this, both of which I no longer have a valid key for.

Video editing:

- I host a youtube channel, made for uploading various content, usually related to gaming. I've done beta testing, tournament hosting, playthroughs, compilations, tutorials, and even animations.
- For editing, I've used Windows Movie Maker, Camtasia Studio 8, CyberLink PowerDirector 16, and DaVinci Resolve (in order). For other tools, I use Photoshop, Audacity, and OBS Studio.
